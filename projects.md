### 2010 Census Data
![Eastern Seaboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patmarks/Ipython-Notebooks/master/census/examples/boswash%20small.png)
[BlockByBlock2010](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/patmarks/blockbyblock2010/blob/master/blockbyblock2010%20examples.ipynb) is a python module I made for for visualizing the 2010 census data at the block level. This allows one to create detailed maps which can distinguish between different neighborhoods and cities based on demographics. The image above shows the population density for the urban corridor between Washington, DC and Boston, MA. In the [large version](https://github.com/patmarks/Ipython-Notebooks/raw/master/census/examples/boswash%20large.png) (6MB image), it's possible to zoom in, and see features such as central park. Here are some other large [example images](https://github.com/patmarks/blockbyblock2010/tree/master/examples) created with the notebook.

### Miscellaneous Jupyter Notebooks

#### Simple Neural Networks
![Network example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patmarks/Ipython-Notebooks/master/neurons/two%20neurons.png)
[Neurons.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/patmarks/Ipython-Notebooks/blob/master/neurons/Neurons.ipynb) shows an example of a biologically-inspired periodic neural network. [Perceptrons.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/patmarks/Ipython-Notebooks/blob/master/neurons/Perceptrons.ipynb) is an example of how neural networks can be used for machine learning.

### A Dice Game
[Threes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/patmarks/Ipython-Notebooks/blob/master/dice/Threes.ipynb) is a dice game involving 5 dice, and a perfect score is ⚂⚂⚂⚂⚂. This notebook is a brief look at the statistics of the game.
