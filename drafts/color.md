#What is Color?


>If a tree falls in the middle of a forest with nobody to hear it (not even a bird), does it make a sound? 


On the first day of an Animal Physiology class, my professor asked this oft-repeated question. The answer, she said with authority, is NO. No sound is made. Sound is a physiological phenomenon, therefor with no physiological processes taking place, no sound is made. Sound is not the vibration of air molecules; sound is the perception of the vibration. That's how it's defined in physiology, and this definition makes it possible to answer a variety of questions. Does a falling tree make a sound if nobody hears it? No. Does a 20Mhz vibration make a sound? Depends on the animal. Which is the louder sound - a firecracker or a firework? Depends how far the observer is.

This isn't to say the physiological definition is the only way to define sound. One can make a physical definition and it's equally as valid. There are even different physiological definitions one can use (are those sounds in your dreams?). So why bother talking about these mutable definitions, and what does it have to do with color? This physiological definition gives a valuable perspective on sound, and the same approach can be used with light. 

First, let's look at what light is. If sound is a manifestation of vibrations through fluid (such as air), then color is the manifestation of light. 


When we think of what sounds look like at a basic level, we might picture something like the waveforms above. And that is a good representation of what the vibrations might look like, if we could see air move near the molecular level. However, let's remember our definition of sound: "jlkjfldskjflksdjflkjsflkjsdlkf slkfjsdlkjf fdsfsd". In this case, the waveforms above are a poor representation of sound, because our ears don't percieve waveforms as a continuous. phenomenon. Rather, the inner ear decomposes the waveform into different frequencies. The cochlea contains a boatload of 'hair' cells, each one representing a slightly different frequency. Hair cells near each other will vibrate at similar frequencies.

Below is a better representation of the waveform above. You can see it's composed of a X hz wave, a Y hz wave, and a Z hz wave. The Z component is most intense. 


when we hear something, there's two fundamental variables at play: Frequency and Intensity. Our mind then processes these inputs over time, percieving a sound. A human voice might stimulate hundreds of hair cells, but the subtle differences in intensities make it distinct from a dog's bark.
