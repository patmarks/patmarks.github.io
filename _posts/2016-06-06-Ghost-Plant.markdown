Monotropa uniflora is usually seen in late summer or early autumn, poking through oak and pine leaves. The strange plant is translucent white, and has a rubbery texture that's cool to the touch. Their likeness to a dead man's fingers is probably why it's called a corpse plant, or ghost plant. It also has the less morbid name, 'Indian pipe plant'. The unique look of this plant is only possible because of its unique ecology.

The total lack of chlorophyll and other pigments is possible because *Monotropa* are parasitic plants. *Monotropa* species are unusual plants in that they're **up** the food chain. They're two whole levels above where photosynthesis happens. And unlike carnivorous plants, which only eat meat for more nitrogen, *Monotropa* derive **all** of their energy from the fungal hosts.

These fungal hosts, [mycrorhizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza), are fungal networks inches below the soil. The networks surround roots to echange nutrients with the tree.In this symbiotic relationship, the fungi receive carbon from the tree while supplying minerals -- particularly phosphorous -- to the tree. 

The ghost plant then comes along, and takes the sugar water supplied to the fungus by the tree. But Monotropa gives nothing in return. Thye're parasites. I drew a crude diagram showing the relationships between the tree, fungus and *Monotropa*.

Green leaves are green because chlorophyll is green, and carrots are orange because of carotenoid pigments. However, with the ghost plant, there no single white compound responsible for the color. Instead, the color is likely from scattering. All visible light enters the cell; rather than being absorbed by chlorophyll, the light then bounces around the particles within the cell walls. This scattering process throws back equal amounts red, green and blue, so the light is white. Mostly.

The inner stem and flower will sometimes have a pink hue. I don’t know if this pigment is taken from the environment, or if it’s produced by the plant to help attract polinators (like bees). The plant has black spots, which appear to be dead/dry specks of the plant. It also occasionally has light blue, which could be due to oxidative damage. The literature on what little color these plants have is sparse.

If you want to find of these, they’re found in most of the US except the rockies.  They’re usually found a few feet from the base of a pine tree, and start emerging in mid-August. You might also find dried up ones, like the picture above. Although of no economic or ecological importance, they’re still pretty cool to look at.
