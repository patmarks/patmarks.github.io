This is my blog. I want something reminiscent of homepages from the 90s. Something like [Stallman.org](http://stallman.org) or [timecube.](http://timecube.com) Something weird, a little gaudy and hopefully a little entertaining.

##### What I need to do:

* Port the posts from miscellanearium.wordpress.com.
* Upload the Waincat generator
* Blog very hard
