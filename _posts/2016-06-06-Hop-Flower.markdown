The flowers are the crown jewels of hops. When mature, they look like soft green pine cones dangling from the bines. They are real flowers, though they’re also called cones, strobiles, or inflorescences (though technically, that’s only a cluster). Hops plants are dioecious, meaning plants are either male or female. Only the female cones are used in making beer, because they’re larger and contain chemicals like lupulone and humulone, which add flavor to — and help preserve– beer.

The flowers are directly attached to a stem-like “strig.” The strigs grow from axillary buds, usually on lateral bines. They can also grow from the main stem, but the lateral bines are where most flowers are. The buds initially look like tiny koosh balls, and only appear after the hops is almost done growing upward. They slowly get  bigger until the end of the season, when the lupulin glands start to produce the valuable resins. Until this point, the flowers don’t smell or taste like anything special.

Lupilin is the bright yellow resin responsible for the flavor and aroma. The unique chemical make-up of the lupulin is what differentiates different strains of hops. If the lupulin has more alpha acids, then it can make the beer more bitter. Other compounds can give a citrus taste, or a pine taste. Virtually all of these flavors are due to terpenes of one kind or another. The lupulin glands are located within

It’s important to keep only female plants on a hops farm, because flowers that produce seeds don’t produce much lupulin. Energy is diverted away from making flavorful oils, and into making a viable seed. I believe my hops were fertilized by some wild plants that I haven’t been able to find. Hops farmers don’t even have a use for the seeds, because when they need more hops, they clone old plants. While it’s possible to grow hops from seeds, but 50% will be male plants. And the other 50%  of hops will have a different flavor profile than its parent. Hops varieties, like apple varieties, are all genetically identical to one another. So a cascade hops in Maine will have the same genetics as a cascade hops in Oregon. There are still breeders of hops, who use seeds to create new varieties, but this is a very long and specialized process. When I make a post about hops roots, I will talk some about the rhizomes which enable cloning of hops.
